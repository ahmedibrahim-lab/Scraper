description: andr\u00e9 paul guillaume gide was a french author and winner of the nobel prize in literature in 1947. gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the symbolist movement, to the advent of anticolonialism between the two world wars.known for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation between the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straight-laced education and a narrow social moralism. gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritan constraints, and gravitates around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. his self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. his political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the ussr.

minneapolis, mn, the united states description: charles monroe schulz was an american cartoonist, whose comic strip peanuts proved one of the most popular and influential in the history of the medium, and is still widely reprinted on a daily basis.schulz's first regular cartoons, li'l folks, were published from 1947 to 1950 by the st. paul pioneer press; he first used the name charlie brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. the series also had a dog that looked much like snoopy. in 1948, schulz sold a cartoon to the saturday evening post; the first of 17 single-panel cartoons by schulz that would be published there. in 1948, schulz tried to have li'l folks syndicated through the newspaper enterprise association. schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. li'l folks was dropped from the pioneer press in january, 1950.later that year, schulz approached the united feature syndicate with his best strips from li'l folks, and peanuts made its first appearance on october 2, 1950. the strip became one of the most popular comic strips of all time. he also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip called it's only a game (1957\u20131959), but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful peanuts. from 1956 to 1965 he contributed a single-panel strip (\"young pillars\") featuring teenagers to youth, a publication associated with the church of god.peanuts ran for nearly 50 years, almost without interruption; during the life of the strip, schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break in late 1997. at its peak, peanuts appeared in more than 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries. schulz stated that his routine every morning consisted of eating a jelly donut and sitting down to write the day's strip. after coming up with an idea (which he said could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours), he began drawing it, which took about an hour for dailies and three hours for sunday strips. he stubbornly refused to hire an inker or letterer, saying that \"it would be equivalent to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts for him.\" in november 1999 schulz suffered a stroke, and later it was discovered that he had colon cancer that had metastasized. because of the chemotherapy and the fact he could not read or see clearly, he announced his retirement on december 14, 1999. schulz often touched on religious themes in his work, including the classic television cartoon, a charlie brown christmas (1965), which features the character linus van pelt quoting the king james version of the bible luke 2:8-14 to explain \"what christmas is all about.\" in personal interviews schulz mentioned that linus represented his spiritual side. schulz, reared in the lutheran faith, had been active in the church of god as a young adult and then later taught sunday school at a united methodist church. in the 1960s, robert l. short interpreted certain themes and conversations in peanuts as being consistent with parts of christian theology, and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel, as he explained in his bestselling paperback book, the gospel according to peanuts, the first of several books he wrote on religion and peanuts, and other popular culture items.from the late 1980s, however, schulz described himself in interviews as a \"secular humanist\": \u201ci do not go to church anymore... i guess you might say i've come around to secular humanism, an obligation i believe all humans have to others and the world we live in.\u201d quotes by: goodreads.com made with \u2764 by zyte", "https://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/deep-thoughts/page/1/": "quotes to scrape quotes

who he wed in 1927. he returned from europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called judge, the leading humor magazine in america at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. additionally, he was submitting cartoons to life, vanity fair and liberty. in some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called flit. these references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for flit. this association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase \"quick, henry, the flit!\" in 1936 on the way to a vaction in europe,

signal corps unit (for which he won the legion of merit) and do documentaries (he won oscar's for hitler lives and design for death). he also created a cartoon called gerald mcboing-boing which also won him an oscar. in may of 1954, life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. the report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. this inspired geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. nine months later, geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published the cat in the hat, which went on to instant success. in 1960 bennett cerf bet geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. the result was green eggs and ham. cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. helen palmer geisel died in 1967.

hampshire, the united kingdom description: jane austen was an english novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in english literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the english landed gentry. she was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. the steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. during this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. from 1811 until 1816, with the release of sense and sensibility (1811), pride and prejudice (1813), mansfield park (1814) and emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. she wrote two additional novels, northanger abbey and persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled sanditon, but died before completing it.austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's a memoir of jane austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great english writer. the second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of austen scholarship and the emergence of a janeite fan culture.

einstein born: march 14, 1879 in ulm, germany description: in 1879, albert einstein was born in ulm, germany. he completed his ph.d. at the university of zurich by 1909. his 1905 paper explaining the photoelectric effect, the basis of electronics, earned him the nobel prize in 1921. his first paper on special relativity theory, also published in 1905, changed the world. after the rise of the nazi party, einstein made princeton his permanent home, becoming a u.s. citizen in 1940. einstein, a pacifist during world war i, stayed a firm proponent of social justice and responsibility. he chaired the emergency committee of atomic scientists, which organized to alert the public to the dangers of atomic warfare.at a symposium, he advised: \"in their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. in their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the good, the true, and the beautiful in humanity itself. this is, to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task . . . \" (\"science, philosophy and religion, a symposium,\" published by the conference on science, philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life, inc., new york, 1941). in a letter to philosopher eric gutkind, dated jan. 3, 1954, einstein stated: \"the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. no interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this,\" (the guardian, \"childish superstition: einstein's letter makes view of religion relatively clear,\" by james randerson, may 13, 2008). d. 1955.while best known for his mass\u2013energy equivalence formula e = mc2 (which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\"), he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". the latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.einstein thought that newtonion mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. this led to the development of his special theory of relativity. he realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity. he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.he was visiting the united states when adolf hitler came to power in 1933 and did not go back to germany. on the eve of world war ii, he endorsed a letter to president franklin d. roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\" and recommending that the u.s. begin similar research. this eventually led to what would become the manhattan project. einstein supported defending the allied forces, but largely denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon. later, with bertrand russell, einstein signed the russell\u2013einstein manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. einstein was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, until his death in 1955.his great intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"einstein\" synonymous with genius.more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_e...http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prize... quotes by: goodreads.com made

critic.james baldwin offered a vital literary voice during the era of civil rights activism in the 1950s and '60s. the eldest of nine children, his stepfather was a minister. at age 14, baldwin became a preacher at the small fireside pentecostal church in harlem. in the early 1940s, he transferred his faith from religion to literature. critics, however, note the impassioned cadences of black churches are still evident in his writing. go tell it on the mountain, his first novel, is a partially autobiographical account of his youth. his essay collections notes of a native son, nobody knows my name, and the fire next time were influential in informing a large white audience.from 1948, baldwin made his home primarily in the south of france, but often returned to the usa to lecture or teach. in 1957, he began spending half of each year in new york city. his novels include giovanni's room, about a white american expatriate who must come to terms with his homosexuality, and another country, about racial and gay sexual tensions among new york intellectuals. his inclusion of gay themes resulted in a lot of savage criticism from the black community. eldridge cleaver, of the black panthers, stated the baldwin's writing displayed an \"agonizing, total hatred of blacks.\" baldwin's play, blues for mister charlie, was produced in 1964. going to meet the man and tell me how long the train's been gone provided powerful descriptions of american racism. as an openly gay man, he became increasingly outspoken in condemning discrimination against lesbian and gay people.on november 30, 1987 baldwin died from stomach cancer in saint-paul-de-vence, france.he was buried at the ferncliff cemetery in hartsdale, near new york city. quotes by: goodreads.com made with \u2764 by zyte",

pen name and, later, legal name of the chilean writer and politician neftal\u00ed ricardo reyes basoalto. neruda assumed his pen name as a teenager, partly because it was in vogue, partly to hide his poetry from his father, a rigid man who wanted his son to have a \"practical\" occupation. neruda's pen name was derived from czech writer and poet jan neruda; pablo is thought to be from paul verlaine. with his works translated into many languages, pablo neruda is considered one of the greatest and most influential poets of the 20th century.neruda was accomplished in a variety of styles ranging from erotically charged love poems like his collection twenty poems of love and a song of despair, surrealist poems, historical epics, and overtly political manifestos. in 1971 neruda won the nobel prize for literature, a controversial award because of his political activism. colombian novelist gabriel garc\u00eda m\u00e1rquez once called him \"the greatest poet of the 20th century in any language.\"on july 15, 1945, at pacaembu stadium in s\u00e3o paulo, brazil, he read to 100,000 people in honor of communist revolutionary leader lu\u00eds carlos prestes. when neruda returned to chile after his nobel prize acceptance speech, salvador allende invited him to read at the estadio nacional before 70,000 people.during his lifetime, neruda occupied many diplomatic posts and served a stint as a senator for the chilean communist party. when conservative chilean president gonz\u00e1lez videla outlawed communism in chile, a warrant was issued for neruda's arrest. friends hid him for months in a house basement in the chilean port of valpara\u00edso. later, neruda escaped into exile through a mountain pass near maihue lake into argentina. years later, neruda was a close collaborator to socialist president salvador allende.neruda was hospitalized with cancer at the time of the chilean coup d'\u00e9tat led by augusto pinochet. three days after being hospitalized, neruda died of heart failure. already a legend in life, neruda's death reverberated around the world. pinochet had denied permission to transform neruda's funeral into a public event. however, thousands of grieving chileans disobeyed the curfew and crowded the streets. neruda's funeral became the first public protest against the chilean military dictatorship. quotes by: goodreads.com made with \u2764 by zyte",

detective fiction for magazines, worked in chautauqua theater and wrote plays. these experiences converged in his later comics career.[2]in 1927, while on sabbatical from wabash, he moved to toledo, ohio as a reporter and drama critic for the news-bee, and he stayed on with that newspaper. eight years later, elmer woggon (a friend at the rival toledo blade) proposed a comic strip for publishers syndicate (later publishers-hall syndicate), the great gusto, which he would draw if saunders did the writing. they shook on it, but it wasn't accepted until they refocused on its indian character. on

her father was estate manager. mary ann, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good education for a young woman of her day. influenced by a favorite governess, she became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. her first published work was a religious poem. through a family friend, she was exposed to charles hennell's an inquiry into the origins of christianity. unable to believe, she conscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. her father shunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister until she promised to reexamine her feelings. her intellectual views did not, however, change. she translated david strauss' das leben jesu, a monumental task, without signing her name to the 1846 work. after her father's death in 1849, mary ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with the westminster review. despite a heavy workload, she translated ludwig feuerbach's the essence of christianity, the only book ever published under her real name. that year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized british society by sending notices to friends announcing she had entered a free \"union\" with george henry lewes, editor of the leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. they lived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social ostracism and financial hardship. she became salaried and

including: adam bede (1859), the mill on the floss (1860), silas marner (1861), romola (1863), and middlemarch (1871). themes included her humanist vision and strong heroines. her poem, \"o may i join the choir invisible\" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: \"o may i join the choir invisible/ of those immortal dead who live again/ in minds made better by their presence. . .\"

hannah more. her headmaster at st michael's, alfred dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the harry potter headmaster albus dumbledore.as a child, rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. she recalls that: \"i can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. certainly the first story i ever wrote down (when i was five or six) was about a rabbit called rabbit. he got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called miss bee.\" at the age of nine, rowling moved to church cottage in the gloucestershire village of tutshill, close to chepstow, wales. when she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who rowling said \"taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,\" gave her a very old copy of jessica mitford's autobiography, hons and rebels. mitford became rowling's heroine, and rowling subsequently read all of her books.rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with the new yorker, \"i wasn\u2019t particularly happy. i think it\u2019s a dreadful time of life.\" she had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). she attended secondary school at wyedean school and college, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. rowling said of her adolescence, \"hermione [a bookish, know-it-all harry potter character] is loosely based on me. she's a caricature of me when i was eleven, which i'm not particularly proud of.\" steve eddy, who taught rowling english when she first arrived, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at english.\" sean harris, her best friend in the upper sixth owned a turquoise ford anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books. quotes by:

porsches in the student lot (for the record, i have my original nose, and never had a car until after i was in my twenties). i was awarded a national merit scholarship, and i used it to pay my way to

going to be doing something anyway, i might as well get course credit for it, right?).i met my husband, pancho (his real name is christiaan), when i was four, but we were never anywhere close to being childhood sweethearts. in fact, though we saw each other at least weekly through church activities, i can't recall a single instance when we so much as greeted each other with a friendly wave, let alone exchanged actual words. this may have been for the best, because when we did eventually get around to exchanging words, sixteen years after our first meeting, it only took nine months from the first \"hello\" to the wedding. of course, we were able to skip over a lot of the getting to know you parts (many of our conversations would go something like this: \"this one time, when i was ten, i broke my hand at a party when-\" \"yeah, i know what happened. i was there, remember?\") we've been married for ten and a half years now, and have three beautiful, brilliant, wonderful boys who often

also includes a vein of comedy that makes their stark themes more palatable. in these works shaw examined education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege.an ardent socialist, shaw was angered by what he perceived to be the exploitation of the working class. he wrote many brochures and speeches for the fabian society. he became an accomplished orator in the furtherance of its causes, which included gaining equal rights for men and women, alleviating abuses of the working class, rescinding private ownership of productive land, and promoting healthy lifestyles. for a short time he was active in local politics, serving on the london county council.in 1898, shaw married charlotte payne-townshend, a fellow fabian, whom he survived. they settled in ayot st. lawrence in a house now called shaw's corner. he is the only person to have been awarded both a nobel prize for literature (1925) and an oscar (1938). the former for his contributions to literature and the latter for his work on the film \"pygmalion\" (adaptation of his play of the same name). shaw wanted to refuse his nobel prize outright, as he had no desire for public honours, but he accepted it at his wife's behest. she considered it a tribute to ireland. he did reject the monetary award, requesting it be used to finance translation of swedish books to english.shaw died at

(quoted in 2,000 years of freethought edited by jim haught.) by 1832, after the untimely death of his first wife, emerson cut loose from unitarianism. during a year-long trip to europe, emerson became acquainted with such intelligentsia as british writer thomas carlyle, and poets wordsworth and coleridge. he returned to the united states in 1833, to a life as poet, writer and lecturer. emerson inspired transcendentalism, although never adopting the label himself. he rejected traditional ideas of deity in favor of an \"over-soul\" or \"form of good,\" ideas which were considered highly heretical. his books include nature (1836), the american scholar (1837), divinity school address (1838), essays, 2 vol. (1841, 1844), nature, addresses and lectures (1849), and three volumes of poetry. margaret fuller became one of his \"disciples,\" as did henry david thoreau.the best of emerson's rather wordy writing survives as epigrams, such as the famous: \"a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\" other one- (and two-) liners include: \"as men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect\" (self-reliance, 1841). \"the most tedious of all discourses are on the subject of the supreme being\" (journal, 1836). \"the word miracle, as pronounced by christian churches, gives a false impression; it is a monster. it is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain\" (address to harvard divinity college, july 15, 1838). he demolished the right wing hypocrites of his era in his essay \"worship\": \". . . the louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons\" (conduct of life, 1860). \"i hate this shallow americanism which hopes to get rich by credit, to get knowledge by raps on midnight tables, to learn the economy of the mind by phrenology, or skill without study, or mastery without apprenticeship\" (self-reliance). \"the first and last lesson of religion is, 'the things that are seen are temporal; the things that are not seen are eternal.' it puts an affront upon nature\" (english traits , 1856). \"the god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.\" (civilization, 1862). he influenced generations of americans, from his friend henry david thoreau to john dewey, and in europe, friedrich nietzsche, who takes up such emersonian themes as power, fate, the uses of poetry and history, and the critique of christianity. d. 1882.more:

of the founding members of the beatles, and together with paul mccartney formed one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.born and raised in liverpool, lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager, his first band, the quarrymen, evolving into the beatles in 1960. as the group began to undergo the disintegration that led to their break-up towards the end of that decade, lennon launched a solo career that would span the next decade, punctuated by critically acclaimed albums, including john lennon/plastic ono band and imagine, and iconic songs such as \"give peace a chance\" and \"imagine\".lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, his writing, on film, and in interviews, and became controversial through his work as a peace activist. he moved to new york city in 1971, where his criticism of the vietnam war resulted in a lengthy attempt by richard nixon's administration to deport him, while his songs were adapted as anthems by the anti-war movement. disengaging himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to his family, lennon reemerged in october 1980 with a new single and a comeback album, double fantasy, but was murdered weeks after their release on the sidewalk outside his home in the dakota. ironically, \"imagine\" (imagine all the people, living life in peace) was a featured cut from this album.lennon's album sales in the united states alone stand at 14 million units, and as performer, writer, or co-writer he is responsible for 27 number one singles on the us hot 100 chart. in 2002, a bbc poll on the 100 greatest britons voted him eighth, and in 2008 rolling stone ranked him the fifth greatest singer of all time. he was posthumously inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 1987 and into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1994.--wikipedia the free encyclopedia -- quotes by: goodreads.com made with \u2764 by zyte", "https://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/activism/page/1/":

helen keller would not be bound by conditions. rendered deaf and blind at 19 months by scarlet fever, she learned to read (in several languages) and even speak, eventually graduating with honors from radcliffe college in 1904, where as a student she wrote the story of my life. that she accomplished all of this in an age when few women attended college and the disabled were often relegated to the background, spoken of only in hushed tones, is remarkable. but keller's many other achievements are impressive by any standard: she authored 13 books, wrote countless articles, and devoted her life to social reform. an active and effective suffragist, pacifist, and socialist (the latter association earned her an fbi file), she lectured on behalf of disabled people everywhere. she also helped start several foundations that continue to improve the lives of the deaf and blind around the world. as a young girl keller was obstinate, prone to fits of violence, and seething with rage at her inability to express herself. but at the age of 7 this wild child was transformed when, at the urging of alexander graham bell, anne sullivan became her teacher, an event she declares \"the most important day i remember in all my life.\" (sullivan herself had once been blind, but partially recovered her sight after a series of operations.) in a memorable passage, keller writes of the day \"teacher\" led her to a stream and repeatedly spelled out the letters w-a-t-e-r on one of her hands while pouring water over the other. this method proved a revelation: \"that living world awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! there were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in time be swept away.\" and, indeed, most of them were.  in her lovingly crafted and deeply perceptive autobiography, keller's joyous spirit is most vividly expressed in her connection to nature:  indeed, everything that could hum, or buzz, or sing, or bloom, had a part in my education.... few know what joy it is to feel the roses pressing softly into the hand, or the beautiful motion of the lilies as they sway in the morning breeze. sometimes i caught an insect in the flower i was plucking, and i felt the faint noise of a pair of wings rubbed together in a sudden terror....  the idea of feeling rather than hearing a sound, or of admiring a flower's motion rather than its color, evokes a strong visceral sensation in the reader, giving the story of my life a subtle power and beauty. keller's celebration of discovery becomes our own. in the end, this blind and deaf woman succeeds in sharpening our eyes and ears to the beauty of the world. --shawn carkonen quotes by: goodreads.com made with \u2764 by zyte", "https://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/opposite/page/1/": "quotes to scrape

e.e. cummings born: october 14, 1894 in cambridge, massachusetts, the united states description: edward estlin cummings was born in cambridge, massachusetts, on october 14, 1894. he began writing poems as early as 1904 and studied latin and greek at the cambridge latin high school.he received his ba in 1915 and his ma in 1916, both from harvard university. his studies there introduced him to the poetry of avant-garde writers, such as gertrude stein and ezra pound.in 1917, cummings published an early selection of poems in the anthology eight harvard poets. the same year, cummings left the united states for france as a volunteer ambulance driver in world war i. five months after his assignment, however, he and a friend were interned in a prison camp by the french authorities on suspicion of espionage (an experience recounted in his novel, the enormous room) for his outspoken anti-war convictions.after the war, he settled into a life divided between houses in rural connecticut and greenwich village, with frequent visits to paris. he also traveled throughout europe, meeting poets and artists, including pablo picasso, whose work he particularly admired.in 1920, the dial published seven poems by cummings, including \"buffalo bill \u2019s.\u201d serving as cummings\u2019 debut to a wider american audience, these \u201cexperiments\u201d foreshadowed the synthetic cubist strategy cummings would explore in the next few years.in his work, cummings experimented radically with form, punctuation, spelling, and syntax, abandoning traditional techniques and structures to create a new, highly idiosyncratic means of poetic expression. later in his career, he was often criticized for settling into his signature style and not pressing his work toward further evolution. nevertheless, he attained great popularity, especially among young readers, for the simplicity of his language, his playful mode and his attention to subjects such as war and sex.the poet and critic randall jarrell once noted that cummings is \u201cone of the most individual poets who ever lived\u2014and, though it sometimes seems so, it is not just his vices and exaggerations, the defects of his qualities, that make a writer popular. but, primarily, mr. cummings\u2019s poems are loved because they are full of sentimentally, of sex, of more or less improper jokes, of elementary lyric insistence.\u201dduring his lifetime, cummings received a number of honors, including an academy of american poets fellowship, two guggenheim fellowships, the charles eliot norton professorship at harvard, the bollingen prize in poetry in 1958, and a ford foundation grant.at the time of his death, september 3, 1962, he was the second most widely read poet in the united states, after robert frost. he is buried in forest hills cemetery in boston, massachusetts.source: http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/e-... quotes by: goodreads.com made with \u2764 by zyte",
